					<div class = "blog_abstract"> 	One of the aims of systems neuroscience is to link neural activity in 
													different stages of brain processing with specific sensations or percepts. 
													This has been accomplished for our senses of touch and vision,not for our 
													sense of smell, or olfaction. To better understand olfaction, we started 
													with a basic sensation common to many sensory systems: intensity.</div>

					<a class = "blog_ref" href = "./blog/deltaC.html" target="_self"> Concentration change detectors in olfaction </a> 
					<div class = "blog_abstract"> 	Olfactory navigation requires comparing of, odor concentration across samples 
													distributed in space and time. One potential strategy of odor source localization 
													is sequential (temporal) comparison: the animal chooses direction in the olfactory 
													surroundings by detecting concentration changes in time (ΔCt). Our results indicate that 
													olfactory cells explicitly compute ΔCt, providing a signal that may guide navigational 
													decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</div>

					<div class = "blog_abstract"> 	Despite the recent advances in neural networks, they still suffer from catastrophic 
													forgetting - the network loses its generalization on a previous task after being trained 
													on a new one. New research suggests that "placing neural network to sleep"​ may solve the 
													catastrophic forgetting issue.</div>
