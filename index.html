				<div class = "content"> I got training as a physicist studying the statistical mechanics of biopolymers under the 
					                    supervision of Prof. Oleg Krichevsky, at Ben-Gurion University, Israel. After completing a 
										Ph.D., I decided to switch to a neuroscience field trying to get some understanding of how 
										things work within our black box. </div>

													and an engineer at work.</div>

				<div class = "content"> I spent a marvelous 5 years at <a href="https://www.janelia.org" > Janelia Research Campus </a> 
					doing my postdoctoral research. I was lucky to work at this top-notch neuroscience institute. 
					My scientific approach was influenced by seminars and launches with amazing researchers like 
					Karel Svoboda, Eric Betzig, and Syndey Brenner. The following quote is driving my research for 
					the last 10 years: 
				</div>

				<div class = "quote"> 
					... I think ignorance in science is very important. If you’re like me 
					and you know too much you can’t try new things. I always work in fields 
					of which I’m totally ignorant.
					<p class = "quote_author">Sydney Brenner</p> 
				</div>

				<div class = "content"> After postdoctoral research, I obtained scientific independence and started to 
										develop approaches to advance our understanding of information processing by the 
										brain. A combination of computational, technological, and experimental approaches 
										lead me to a number of 
										<a href="research.html" target="_self"> 
										conceptually novel discoveries </a> and set of technological developments. 
				</div>

				<div class = "content"> My laboratory developed a closed-loop 
										<a href="https://www.rosco.tech/products/concentration-change-manifold"> 
										odor delivery system </a>that allows switching between odor concentrations on 
										the single sniff scale (Bizer et al. in preparation). This development led to 
										the discovery of neurons that keep the memory of changes in odor concentration 
										providing a signal that may guide navigational decisions (Parabucki et al. 2019).
				</div>

				<div class = "content"> In January 2018 I joined a scientifically-based start-up company <a href="http://www.bel.company" target="_blank"> Brain Electrophysiological Laboratory </a> (BEL) founded by Prof. Don Tucker. The BEL mission is to advance the science of human neural systems through modeling and analysis with artificial neural systems. Here, I am simulating cortical function via neuromorphic modeling and leading the engineering development of noninvasive technologies for 1) sleep improvement and 2) relief from Parkinson’s disease symptoms.</div>
