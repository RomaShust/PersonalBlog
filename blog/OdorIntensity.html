				<div class = "title">Coding of perceived odor intensity</div>
			
				<div class = "blog_content"> One of the aims of systems neuroscience is to link neural activity in different stages 
										of brain processing with specific sensations or percepts. This has been accomplished 
										for our senses of touch and vision, but not for our sense of smell, or olfaction. To 
										better understand olfaction, we started with a basic sensation common to many sensory 
										systems: intensity. Based on prior work, we knew that mammals (rats and humans) compare 
										quantities (concentrations) of different odors based on their perceived intensity.
				</div>
				
				<div class = "blog_content"> Previous work showed that neuronal activity in different parts of the brain (the piriform 
										cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala) correlates with odor concentration.  However, 
										this is not enough evidence for consistency with perception. In rats and humans, the 
										perceived intensity of odors grows systematically with their concentration but rapidly 
										decreases after prolonged sampling (or sniffing) due to adaptation. Thus, perceived 
										intensity for a given odor is a function of at least two variables: the physical 
										concentration of an odor outside the nose and the sampling duration. Therefore, in order 
										for a neuronal response to represent intensity, it must change consistently with 
										concentration and adaptation.
				</div>	
				
				<div class = "blog_content"> We hypothesized that a neural representation, or code, for odor intensity may already 
											 exist in the activity patterns of mitral and tufted cells (MTC) in the olfactory bulb. 
											 To test this hypothesis, we characterized changes in electrophysiological activity of 
											 MTCs as a function of odor concentration and adaptation and examined them for consistency 
											 erception. MTCs respond to odors not only by changing the total number of spikes they 
											 fire (rate code) but also by changing how spikes are distributed over time or their 
											 temporal pattern. During every sniff cycle, MTCs fire a characteristic pattern of spikes. 
											 When a new odor is presented, this pattern can change even while the total number of spikes 
											 remains the same (temporal code).

				<div class = "blog_content"> We first looked at how MTC odor responses change as a function of odor 
					concentration (Fig. 1).  We next examined changes in responses due to adaptation by comparing the 
					response on the first sniff of odor with consecutive sniffs; Fig. 3).  We compared how MTC responses 
					change with concentration and adaptation based on total spike count (rate code; Fig. 5) and as well as 
					spike temporal pattern (temporal code; Fig. 4). We found that changes in the total number of spikes 
					fired by MTCs were not similar to odor dilution and adaptation (Fig. 5).  However, the temporal pattern 
					of the spikes within each sniff changed in suggestively similar ways, in terms of both the latency and 
					the amplitude of the response.
				</div>

				<div class = "blog_content"> Each odorant activates multiple different receptor types and thus multiple MTCs 
					in the olfactory bulb. Therefore, odors are likely represented by the activity of multiple cells, so we 
					looked at how does odor concentration encoded by a population of MTCs. To do this, we grouped the measured 
					responses of MTCs together into population response vectors (PRVs).  We build a PRV for each sniff of each 
					odor concentration on each odor presentation (or trial). We ended up with many PRVs.  To see how these PRVs 
					change across concentration and sniff number we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which helps 
					identify the most meaningful basis to re-express a noisy, data set. The assumption underlying PCA is that 
					this new basis (or principal components, PCs) will filter out the noise and reveal the most prominent 
					features of the data set. We visualized PRV responses on each sniff and concentration by plotting the 
					responses in the space of the first three PCs, which accounted for 70% of the total variance in our data 
					set (Fig. 6).  This showed that changes in PRVs with concentration and adaptation were similar to each 
					other and therefore consistent with a representation of odor intensity. From this, we formed the following 
					hypothesis: adaptation should make it harder to distinguish PRVs for different concentrations.
				</div>

				<div class = "blog_content"> We tested this hypothesis quantitatively. Animals can gauge odor intensity from a 
					single sniff of odor, so we checked how well a simple computer algorithm, called a classifier, could 
					identify odor concentration based on the Euclidean distance between a single PRV and the average PRVs 
					observed for different concentrations. Using PRVs from the first sniff of odor the classifier was able 
					to identify the coded concentration with 92% accuracy. But performance using subsequent sniffs fell below 
					78% (Fig. 7B). Thus, although concentration information was still largely intact after adaptation, odor 
					concentrations were harder to distinguish, consistent with our first hypothesis.
				</div>

				<div class = "blog_content"> To summarize, we compared neural activity in the mouse olfactory bulb with odor 
					intensity perception in humans. We found the two to be consistent.  Odor responses changed with decreasing 
					concentration and repeated sampling of a constant odor source in similar ways. Using a classifier, we found 
					that the odor concentration coded on later sniffs was sharply lower than on the first sniff. These neural 
					results were consistent with the sharp sniff to sniff drop in odor intensity reported by human volunteers. 
					Our data suggest that responses of neurons in the olfactory bulb are consistent with odor intensity perception.
