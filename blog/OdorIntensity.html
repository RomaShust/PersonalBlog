					<div class = "blog_abstract"> 	One of the aims of systems neuroscience is to link neural activity in 
													different stages of brain processing with specific sensations or percepts. 
													This has been accomplished for our senses of touch and vision,not for our 
													sense of smell, or olfaction. To better understand olfaction, we started 
													with a basic sensation common to many sensory systems: intensity.</div>

					<div class = "blog_abstract"> 	Olfactory navigation requires comparing of, odor concentration across samples 
													distributed in space and time. One potential strategy of odor source localization 
													is sequential (temporal) comparison: the animal chooses direction in the olfactory 
													surroundings by detecting concentration changes in time (ΔCt). Our results indicate that 
													olfactory cells explicitly compute ΔCt, providing a signal that may guide navigational 
													decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</div>

				<div class = "content"> My laboratory developed a closed-loop 
										<a href="https://www.rosco.tech/products/concentration-change-manifold"> 
										odor delivery system </a>that allows switching between odor concentrations on 
										the single sniff scale (Bizer et al. in preparation). This development led to 
										the discovery of neurons that keep the memory of changes in odor concentration 
										providing a signal that may guide navigational decisions (Parabucki et al. 2019).

				<div class = "content"> In January 2018 I joined a scientifically-based start-up company <a href="http://www.bel.company" target="_blank"> Brain Electrophysiological Laboratory </a> (BEL) founded by Prof. Don Tucker. The BEL mission is to advance the science of human neural systems through modeling and analysis with artificial neural systems. Here, I am simulating cortical function via neuromorphic modeling and leading the engineering development of noninvasive technologies for 1) sleep improvement and 2) relief from Parkinson’s disease symptoms.</div>
