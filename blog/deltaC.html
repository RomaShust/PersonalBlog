				<div class = "blog_content"> Olfactory navigation requires comparing of, odor concentration across samples distributed 
											in space and time. One potential strategy of odor source localization is sequential (temporal) 
											comparison: the animal chooses direction in the olfactory surroundings by detecting 
											concentration changes in time (ΔCt) across consecutive inhalations. To study the neural 
											processing of ΔCt, we developed an odor delivery system that allows rapid switching and 
											stabilization of different concentrations of an odor, such that concentration can be changed 
											on each sniff. We monitored activity of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells in the olfactory bulb of 
											mice in response to prolonged concentration presentations and to stimuli that flicker between 
											concentrations from sniff to sniff. We find that a subset of M/T responses are sensitive to ΔCt, 
											responding primarily to concentration changes. Our results indicate that M/T cells explicitly 
											compute ΔCt, providing a signal that may guide navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.
